**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when multiple people are working on the same project or
  when I am working from multiple system
  
**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  I may not want to pull the changes from some other people
  I may be working on the same file and I may end up with conflicts
